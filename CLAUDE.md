# CLAUDE.md — CarverCraft

## Project
Lapidary & jewelry tech mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 on NeoForge (21.1.x), built from the MDK-1.21.1-ModDevGradle template. Mod id: `carvercraft`. Java 21, official Mojang mappings.

## Vision
A gem pipeline from geology to magic: find and tumble rough gems → cut them → silversmith jewelry → enchanted rings and amulets worn in Curios slots. Tone: geologically honest wherever possible. The developer is an amateur lapidary — real-world accuracy in rock/gem pairings is a feature, not flavor text.

## Locked design decisions
- **Curios API** is the baubles system (Baubles died with 1.12; Curios is the ecosystem standard). Rings/amulets/charms register into Curios slots; equipped effects use attribute modifiers.
- **Jewelry effects** use 1.21's data-driven enchantments (JSON) wherever possible; write code only when JSON can't express the effect.
- **Silver ore** worldgen is pure JSON: configured feature + placed feature + biome modifier. No worldgen code.
- **Rough gems drop from stone types** via NeoForge Global Loot Modifiers — e.g. andesite → jasper, granite → garnet, basalt → agate. Keep pairings geologically plausible; defer to the developer on geology.
- **Vanilla gems integrate**: lapis, emerald, diamond, amethyst (plus the mod's ruby) can be cut into faceted forms. High content-per-effort since players already have these materials.
- **Rock Tumbler** (first machine): passive, zero energy, deliberately slow — real tumbling takes weeks, and the in-game slowness is the flavor. No GUI in v0.1; right-click interaction only.
- **Trim Saw & Faceting Station** (later): FE-powered through capabilities so Mekanism/IE cables interoperate with zero glue code; full GUIs; JSON recipe types.
- **Idaho identity**: the endgame gem is the **star garnet** (Idaho's state gem, found in roughly two places on Earth), and **Bruneau jasper** exists as a distinct jasper variety. This is the mod's signature. Keep it.

## Build order
- **v0.1** — silver ore + deepslate variant, rough-gem loot drops, Rock Tumbler (block + block entity + server ticker), cut gem items
- **v0.2** — Curios dependency, silver ingot/band crafting, first rings (band + cut gem determines effect), attribute modifiers while equipped
- **v0.3** — Trim Saw + Faceting Station: FE buffers, Menu/Screen/ContainerData GUIs, custom recipe types
- **v0.4** — data-driven jewelry enchantments, jasper varieties, star garnet endgame content

## Conventions
- Registration via DeferredRegister. As content grows, split into ModItems / ModBlocks / ModBlockEntities / ModCreativeTabs classes instead of one god-class.
- Assets under `assets/carvercraft/`, data under `data/carvercraft/`.
- Hand-written JSON is fine early; move to datagen once item count justifies it.
- Machine logic is server-side only; never trust the client. Sync display state through ContainerData or block entity data packets.
- Keep change sets small and runnable — the Client run config should boot cleanly after every step.
- The existing `ruby` item is the hello-world artifact; fold it into the real gem set (rough ruby → cut ruby) rather than deleting it.

## Developer context
Experienced infrastructure engineer (Linux/HPC, strong git/CLI), newer to Java, Gradle, and Minecraft modding specifically. When a Java-ecosystem or Minecraft-specific idiom is load-bearing (capabilities, client/server siding, registries, the event bus), briefly explain the why. Skip explanations of general engineering concepts.

## Current state
v0.1 + Rock Tumbler redesigned as **four independent lanes**. Each lane is furnace-shaped: input slot -> horizontal progress arrow -> output slot, with its own clock. Lanes never batch together; dropping a gem in lane 3 does not touch lane 1. Output slots are output-only (mayPlace=false); a lane stalls if its output is full or holds a different gem. GUI is 176x190 with the player inventory moved down.

Design note: the earlier single-batch 2x2 + circular progress ring was replaced. The ring had two bugs (bottom-up reveal instead of a sweep, and it overlapped the 4th slot); horizontal furnace-style arrows are trivially correct (left-to-right width reveal) and the per-lane model fixes batching. Do not reintroduce the ring.

Particles work via a RUNNING blockstate (vanilla LIT) that the ticker flips when any lane is active — block states sync to the client for free, which is why animateTick fires. ContainerData syncs the 4 lane clocks + shared batch length to the open screen.

TESTING VALUES to dial back before release: silver count=40/size=12/band -48..80 (release: 6/8/-48..32); TICKS_PER_GEM=30s.

Not compile-verified in CI. Textures are placeholder programmer art. Next: v0.2 (Curios + rings).
